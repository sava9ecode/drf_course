# Completed Django Rest Framework (DRF) Course

In this course I learned how to use Python and the Django REST Framework (DRF) to build a web API.  
There are two Django apps in this project. First app is core that hold the logic for contact us endpoint.  
Another one is ecommerce that hold the logic for items and orders endpoints.

## What was done:
- Add settings and URL configurations
- Create first API endpoint
- Write unit tests
- Create endpoints with authentication
- Create item and order models and serializers
- Code viewsets and routers
- Write final unit tests

## Quick start

This project uses docker, so you have to install it.  
Next, follow the commands below:
```
git clone git@github.com:sava9ecode/drf_course.git
docker compose up
```

That's it. Use browser or tools like httpie/curl. Have fun.
